Applied Visual Design: Move a Relatively Positioned Element with CSS Offsets
The CSS offsets of top or bottom, and left or right tell the browser how far to offset an item
relative to where it would sit in the normal flow of the document. You're offsetting an element away
from a given spot, which moves the element away from the referenced side (effectively, the opposite direction).
As you saw in the last challenge, using the top offset moved the h2 downwards. Likewise, using a left offset
moves an item to the right.

Use CSS offsets to move the h2 15 pixels to the right and 10 pixels up.

Your code should use a CSS offset to relatively position the h2 10px upwards. In other words, move it 10px
 away from the bottom of where it normally sits.
Your code should use a CSS offset to relatively position the h2 15px towards the right. In other words, move
 it 15px away from the left of where it normally sits.
