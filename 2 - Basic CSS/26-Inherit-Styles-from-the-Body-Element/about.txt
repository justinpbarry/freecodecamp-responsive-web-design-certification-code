Basic CSS: Inherit Styles from the Body Element
Now we've proven that every HTML page has a body element, and that its body element can also be
styled with CSS.

Remember, you can style your body element just like any other HTML element, and all your other
elements will inherit your body element's styles.


First, create a h1 element with the text Hello World

Then, let's give all elements on your page the color of green by adding color: green; to your
body element's style declaration.

Finally, give your body element the font-family of monospace by adding font-family: monospace;
to your body element's style declaration.

Create an h1 element.
Your h1 element should have the text Hello World.
Make sure your h1 element has a closing tag.
Give your body element the color property of green.
Give your body element the font-family property of monospace.
Your h1 element should inherit the font monospace from your body element.
Your h1 element should inherit the color green from your body element.
