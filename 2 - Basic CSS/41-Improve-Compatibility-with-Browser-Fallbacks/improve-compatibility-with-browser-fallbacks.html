<!-- It looks like a variable is being used to set the background color of the .red-box class.
Let's improve our browser compatibility by adding another background declaration right before the existing
declaration and set its value to red. -->

<style>
  :root {
    --red-color: red;
  }
  .red-box {

    background: red;
    background: var(--red-color);
    height: 200px;
    width:200px;
