Basic CSS: Override Class Declarations by Styling ID Attributes
We just proved that browsers read CSS from top to bottom. That means that, in the event of a conflict,
 the browser will use whichever CSS declaration came last.

But we're not done yet. There are other ways that you can override CSS. Do you remember id attributes?

Let's override your pink-text and blue-text classes, and make your h1 element orange, by giving the h1
 element an id and then styling that id.


Give your h1 element the id attribute of orange-text. Remember, id styles look like this:

<h1 id="orange-text">

Leave the blue-text and pink-text classes on your h1 element.

Create a CSS declaration for your orange-text id in your style element. Here's an example of what this
 looks like:

#brown-text {
  color: brown;
}
Note: It doesn't matter whether you declare this CSS above or below pink-text class, since id attribute
 will always take precedence.

Your h1 element should have the class pink-text.
Your h1 element should have the class blue-text.
Give your h1 element the id of orange-text.
There should be only one h1 element.
Create a CSS declaration for your orange-text id
Do not give your h1 any style attributes.
Your h1 element should be orange.
